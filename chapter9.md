# Chapter 9: Classes

Objects are abstractions: packages a set of values and operations that can be easily referenced

Class definitions contain:
* definitions of all methods that can be used on the object
* definitions of data structures used to maintain the state

Class names are typically capitalized

method definitions must include a "self" parameter, even though the variable name when the method is called binds the object instance to the method

Most classes include __init__ as the constructor to to initialize the object's attributes

Attributes of an object are represented as instance variables

Accessors: allow you to view the object's state

Mutators: allow you to modify an object's state

* Plan the behavior and attributes of the objects of your new class
* Choose an appropriate class name and methods
* Write a test script to instantiate the class and use its methods
* Choose the best data structures to represent the attributes
* Fill the class template with an __init__ method and a __str__ method
* Complete and test the remaining methods
* Document your code, include a docstring
