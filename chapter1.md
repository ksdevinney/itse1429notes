# What is Computer Programming?

A computer program is a solution to a problem. Uses an algorithm (set of instructions) to tell the computer what to do. Consists of input, process, and output.

### 1.1A Algorithms

Algorithm: sequence of steps in a computational process
* Has a finite number of steps
* Each individual instruction is well-defined
* Process eventually halts
* Solves a general class of problems

### 1.1B Information Processing

The process of converting input to output, following steps of some kind

## 1.2 Modern Computer Structure

Computers consist of hardware and software. Hardware: physical devices. Software: set of algorithms, programs

Input devices: mouse, keyboard

Output devices: screen, speakers, network ports

Input devices convert human-accessible information into information for computer processing, then output devices convert the results of processing for accessibility to humans

Information is stored in memory (RAM), sent to the CPU for processing

RAM is lost when the computer is turned off, external/secondary memory is more permanent

### 1.2B Computer Software

Machine code: program stored in memory in binary digits
Loader: loads machine language instructions into the appropraite memory
System software, operating system: manages and schedules concurrently running programs
Application software (app): program designed for a specific task

Programmer writes program in *high-level programming language*, runs a translator to turn it into machine code, then it can be excuted by the run time system

## 1.3 Computing Systems

### 1.3A

Abacus

### 1.3B

ENIAC, Mark I, ABC

### 1.3C First Programming Languages

Assembly Languages

FORTRAN

COBOL

## 1.4 Getting Started With Python

Invented by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s

High-level, general purpose language

### 1.4A Running Code

Interpreted Language, simple expressions can be run in the *shell*

IDLE: Integrated Development Environment

### 1.4B Input, Processing, Output

Output using print(<expression>)

Ask the user for input using:
<variable identifier> = input(<string prompt>)
