# Chapter 3: Loops and Selection Statements

## 3.1 The For Loop

Loops repeat an action- each repetition is a "pass" or "iteration"

*definite iterations* repeat a predefined number of times, *indefinite iterations* repeat until the program tells it to stop

for <variable> in range(<integer expression>):
    <statement>

Integer expression determines how many times the loop will run, can be a constant
First line is called the loop header
Loop body is the statements to be executed (must be indented and aligned)
