# Chapter 6: Design with Functions

Abstraction: coping with complexity by simplifying ot hiding it

Functions can help eliminate redundancy in programs (can use a function instead of re-writing the same algorithm each time)

Hide complexity:

Algorithm: general method for solving a class of problems, individual problems that make up the "class" are *problem instances*

Each function should provide a single coherent task

## Top-Down Design

Starts with a global view of the problem, then breaks it into smaller pieces

## Recursive Functions

recursive: a function that calls itself

Function may run once, then call itself using the results from previous run as parameters

Most recursive functions expect at least one argument, to test the base case that ends the recursive process
