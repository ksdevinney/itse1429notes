# Chapter 6: Design with Functions

Abstraction: coping with complexity by simplifying ot hiding it

Functions can help eliminate redundancy in programs (can use a function instead of re-writing the same algorithm each time)

Hide complexity:

Algorithm: general method for solving a class of problems, individual problems that make up the "class" are *problem instances*

Each function should provide a single coherent task
