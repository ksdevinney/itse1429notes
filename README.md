# Programming Logic and Design

These are notes I took while taking ITSE 1429, Programming Logic and Design, during spring 2022 at Dallas College.

This class focused on the basics of programming, using Python. Each chapter's notes are linked below- some chapters are more thorough than others, based on what I did or did not already understand.

Lab activities corresponding to each chapter are placed in the "labs" folder. Each program contains a short description of what it is meant to do.

Overall, I really enjoyed this class! I feel like I learned a lot. Python was also a very fun language to learn, and I hope I have the opportunity to practice with it more in the future.
